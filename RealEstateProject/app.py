# Libaries

# Flask 
#  - Flask is a lightweight WSGI web framework
#  - Helps gets started quickly with building and scaling an application
from flask import Flask

# - To make HTTP Requests
# - Automatically adds query strings, by adding parameters. But I did not do that
# - Keep Alive and https connection pooling is done automatically 
import requests 

# - To prevent IP address blacklist from too many Requests
import time
from random import randint

# Data Science Libaries to parse ZipCode Files
# Numpy is not used in this application 
# Numpys is used for multidiemntional arrays 
# Pandas is great for in-memory 2d table objects called Dataframe
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# - For parsing result 
import re

# - For Sending Email
